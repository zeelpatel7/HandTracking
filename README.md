# HandTracking
This project consists of two different functionalities - ability to use a virtual mouse through hand gesture recognition along with the detection of sign language. 

## Virtual Mouse 
This works on the following concepts - 
1. OpenCV
2. Python libraries such as numpy

The module is first created for hand tracking which recognises and detects the hand along with the fingers. The finger tips are defined by certain numeric descriptions. Each joint is also given a numeric description. The output from the module is thus an array that is created which mentions the certain joint number along with its x and y coordinates. These coordinates let us know exactly what movement are the fingers along with the hand making.
